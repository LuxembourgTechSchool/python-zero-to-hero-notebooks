    "Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. As the name can hint, OOP is a conceptual model that focuses on structuring your software with objects in a particular way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, here we will only scratch the basics of object-oriented programming and we will focus on how to get up to speed quickly so you get the feeling for organising your code in a clean way rather than trying to learn all the abstract concepts! Python's class mecanism is not difficult because it adds very little new syntax and semantics.\n",

    "## What is a class?\n",

    "\n",
    "A class is also like a definition. A class defines the characteristics of any object of this class. By characteristics we actually mean attributes and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we would have a class defining a human. This class would hold attributes such as height, weight, age, gender, name and methods or functions such as eat(), sleep(), walk() or run().\n",

    "## What is an instance?\n",

    "With a class, we can create objects of this class. Those objects are called instances! \n",
